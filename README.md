# Milestone Project 2 - Funtasia Holiday Website 
---
This website was created for people looking who are looking for a different kind of experience than your standard holiday. The idea behind the site is you will be going to an unknown destination. Essentially paying for everything and showing up on the day with nothing needed, the site will cover eveything for you. You will see the 3 most popular continents at the moment, with the most popular cities in the continent. The user can then submit an application and also include information for future destination requests and then we will be in contact with them to go through further details.

# UX
---
As this site is aimed at holiday destinations, bright colours are used to bring a more friendly theme to the site. The first 2 pages are the blue and white contrast, the final 2 pages also use this same contrast but include a greyed out photo in the background for some progression as you go through the different web pages. The overall experience to be as easy as possible for the consumer to go throught the site and not to overload with information.

Home page is kept minimal with large images to catch the users attention. The hero image is a couple walking along a beach that fits nicely with the colour scheme. Below this we have 3 of the most popular destinations, images of each destination are placed in seperate carousels for the user to click through. Finally the page is completed with some information about the site and what the company do.

Destinations page is a little more detailed for the user. A google map is at the top of the page, the user can click 3 buttons above the map to bring them to each continent. Below this is 3 videos of each continent with information about the continent to the side. The colour scheme is the same as the home page and the heading for each continent has a text shadow, which is the same text shadow used for the 3 destinations on the home page to keep the theme going. Bright colours and easy experience for the user again.

Reviews page again keeps things quite simple, there are 7 reviews listed at the top of the page for users to look over. They are placed in cards and very visible. Below the reviews is an interactive pie chart for users to click through and see the percantage of customers that are happy/unhappy etc. This is all placed over a greyed out holiday image, keeping the same colour scheme as prevous pages.

Contact us page, again keeps the same colour scheme and also has a greyed out photo. Keeping things again minimal for the customer the bottom of the page will contain some more information on the process of how to apply for one of the holidays. The form is easy to fill in and upon submitting a message will display on screen to confirm we have received the application and will be in touch shortly.

## User Stories

The website is aimed at people not looking for your standard holiday. They are willing to leave it all in the hands of the company, just showing up on the day to receive everything they need along with the destination. Below are somer user stories for these people.

1. As somebody who travels quite a lot, I find this website intruiging, just down to the simple fact of not knowing where I will go. I sometimes spend quite a lot of time trying to find the perfect destination, this is a good idea to take it all out of my hands and allow them to just take over.

2. As somebody who only goes on one holiday per year, I'm not sure if I like the idea of not knowing where I'm going. The website is easy to navigate, and I like the fact I can click through the different continents and actually see some of the potential city's I might go to. The reviews are interesting to say the least. With the contact form so easy to fill out, I think I will fill it in at least and see where I go once they come back to me with more details. 

3. As a family going on holiday, I don't think this site would be suited to me. It is very capativating, the site is easy to move around. I like the videos they have prepared along with the information so easy to read. If I was going on holiday without my young children I would definitely go for this as it is such a good idea. I just couldn't risk getting the wrong destination with young kids, maybe when there a little older I'll come back then!

4. As a college student finishing up for the summer this is perfect for me. I will suggest this to my college classmates as this could be the perfect way for us to finish up the year by going on this trip. Some of the possible destinations on the destination page are all places I want to go so I don't mind where we end up. The fact I just literally have to show up is great. The only thing I didn't like is the fact no prices are available. What I will do is apply on the contact us page and also ask about group rates for me and my friends going.

5. As a couple about to get married this site is great. I have been looking at the destinations page and I have never been to any of the ones listed. The reviews all seem great. I like the fact it seems almost to not give away too much without you applying. I am already sold on the idea and the videos of each continent they have a the moment. We will look to use this as our honeymoon holiday. The fact we can just show up after the wedding with nothing at all will be brilliant. I want to find out more details, prices etc so I will fill in the contact-us form.
